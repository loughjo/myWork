# Program reads in two numbers and subtracts the first one from the second one.

firstNumber = int(input('Enter your first number : '))
secondNumber = int(input('Enter your second number : '))

#print('str(firstNumber) + " minus " + str(secondNumber) + " is " + str(firstNumber + secondNumber)')

print(str(firstNumber) + " minus " + str(secondNumber) + " is " + str(firstNumber - secondNumber))
